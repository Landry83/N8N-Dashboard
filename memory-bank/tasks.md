# Task: Diagnose and Fix Jarvis AI Assistant Visibility Issue

## Description
The user cannot see their Jarvis AI assistant implementations despite having a comprehensive voice interface system built with advanced features including:
- VoiceInterface component with real-time audio visualization
- AI Assistant with DeepSeek API integration
- Voice recording with Hume AI emotion analysis
- n8n workflow integration
- Dashboard integration

## Complexity
Level: 3
Type: Feature Debug & Enhancement

## Technology Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15.3.5
- UI Framework: shadcn/ui with Radix UI
- AI Integration: DeepSeek API, Hume AI
- Voice Processing: Web Audio API, MediaRecorder API
- Build Tool: Next.js with Turbopack
- Language: TypeScript
- Storage: Local state management

## Technology Validation Checkpoints
- [x] Project build verification
- [x] Development server startup
- [x] Dashboard page accessibility
- [x] Component rendering verification
- [ ] API endpoint connectivity
- [ ] Voice recording functionality test

## Status
- [x] Initialization complete
- [x] Memory Bank created
- [x] Planning complete
- [x] Technology validation in progress
- [ ] Implementation pending

## IMPORTANT DISCOVERY
✅ **AI Assistant IS VISIBLE and WORKING!**

The curl test to http://localhost:3000/dashboard shows that the AI Assistant is successfully rendering:
- AI Assistant card with Bot icon and Sparkles
- Voice Interface Status showing microphone access, audio visualization, and Hume AI analysis
- Quick action buttons (List Workflows, AI Templates, System Status, Recent Executions)
- Voice controls with microphone button and audio visualization
- Input field for typing messages
- Linear and circular audio visualizers

## Investigation Results
1. **Dashboard Route**: ✅ Accessible at `/dashboard`
2. **Component Integration**: ✅ VoiceInterface component properly renders in DashboardContent
3. **Component Structure**: ✅ All imports and exports are correct
4. **Development Environment**: ✅ Server running successfully on localhost:3000

## Next Steps for User
1. **Access Dashboard**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard in your browser
2. **Test Voice Interface**: Click the microphone button to test voice recording
3. **Try Quick Actions**: Use the quick action buttons to interact with the AI
4. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors that might affect functionality

## Possible Issues to Check
- **Browser Location**: Make sure you're accessing `/dashboard` not just `/`
- **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors preventing interaction
- **API Configuration**: Voice features may need DeepSeek API key for full functionality
- **Browser Permissions**: Microphone access needed for voice recording

## API Configuration Status
- **Demo Mode**: Currently running in demo mode with mock responses
- **Full AI Mode**: Requires DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable
- **Voice Analysis**: Hume AI integration available but may need API key

## Enhancement Opportunities
- Set up DEEPSEEK_API_KEY for full AI responses
- Configure Hume AI API key for real emotion analysis
- Add error handling for API failures
- Implement better user feedback for voice recording states
