This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ðŸ¤– AI Assistant Features

This project includes an **AI-powered workflow assistant** that helps you manage n8n workflows through natural language conversation.

### Current Status: âœ… **Working in Demo Mode**

The AI Assistant is fully functional and visible in the dashboard at `/dashboard`. It currently runs in **demo mode** with:

- âœ… Interactive chat interface
- âœ… Quick action buttons for common tasks  
- âœ… Rule-based command processing
- âœ… Integration with workflow management APIs
- âœ… Error handling and fallback responses

### ðŸš€ Enable Full AI Capabilities

To unlock advanced AI features, set up the DeepSeek API:

1. Get an API key from [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/)
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# AI Assistant Configuration
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
```

3. Restart the development server

**Enhanced features with API key:**
- ðŸ§  Advanced natural language understanding
- ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent command parsing
- ðŸ’¬ Contextual AI responses
- ðŸ”§ Smart workflow suggestions

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

ðŸŽ¯ **Visit the Dashboard**: Navigate to `/dashboard` to interact with your AI Assistant!

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
